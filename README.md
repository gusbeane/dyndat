Actions are weak stellar age indicators in the Milky Way Disk

Empirically determining the relation between stellar actions and ages

Main conclusions:
* There is a lot of spread in the action-age relationship (though there is a gradient!). The spread in the relation effectively dooms any attempt to infer ages from actions.
* Alpha-enriched stars are not dynamically distinct from alpha-poor stars.
